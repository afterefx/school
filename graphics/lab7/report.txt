Name: Christopher Carlisle
Hours: 8 hours
Problems: no problems
Testing: trial and error by playing the game. I would implement one
	thing at a time and test it as I put it in.
Solution: I started off with Edward Angels paritcle program and removed
	 all but one particles. I also reorganized and a couple of 
	 other things I then resized it and put 2 more cubes in
	 on the left and right side. Fixed the glLookAt so that it had the 
	 perspective that I wanted and then started working on collision 
	 detection. I have one function for the left paddle and one for the
	 right. These return bools. Once I had it bouncing and collisions
	 working I then added in keys to rotate and reset the game.
