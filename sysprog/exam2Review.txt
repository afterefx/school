--------
mostly like exam 1
theory or short answer question
majorly going to be small programs, what is output

signals
don't worry about all different signals, only typical ones, sigalarm
how to handle signals
how to ignore signals, using sigign
sigstop
sigcontinue
how to pause/wait
how to send signals using kill
what happens when the children die and how to take care of problem, typically what the sigchild singal is
sigstop sigcont

setpgid and those things
SIGTTIN and why it's generated

IPC
pipes, and named/unamed
how they actuall work, terminology and background
know rules on pipes
what close on one side and other side
go over programs on pipes
hwo to create named pipes
what are the differnet modes on named pipes, blocking/nonblocking
programs on named pipes
---

sockets
what are different sockets and what are the different domains of sockets
go over functions of sockets
function to create, function to give name (bind)
may not be expecting complete syntax
how to close a socket
if given a server and client program should be able to know what is going on

inet_addr
gethostiname
what function returns 32bit addr
htonl  just know what those functiosn do

shared memory know all functions
hwo to allocate/deallocate
ipcstat what does it do
go over next program

semaphores
not complicated programs, very simple programs like on slides
might directly give same program but may remove comments and ask what it does.
last program on semaphores
don't worry about SEM_UNDO with all the situations, just basic understanding
go over last semaphore example and obtain a semaphore that is already created

cat and variants buffering
what happens with buffering for system calls, no diff b/c they are like library calls
don't waste time on ch6

log files
how to generate them
what the various options do when used inside an open function what is an atomic function
what is the setuid bit

ch5, 8 9 important for exam

threads
diff between process and thread
what is multithreading
what are kernel level threads, what are user level threads
know all functions on threads know names and what they do
dont' worry about solaris
check out examples at bottom

go over mutexes and condition variables
