Formulate the data definition for lists of words. 
Systematically make up examples of words and lists of words

A list-of-words is either

    1. the empty list, empty, or
    2. (cons text low) where text is a word ('red, 'edr, 
        ..., 'der) and low is a list of words

Develop the function average-age. It consumes a family tree 
node and the current year. It produces the average age of all 
people in the family tree. 

;; count-age : ftn  ->  number
;; finds the number of people in a family tree
(define (count-age a-ftree)
 (cond
  [(empty? a-ftree) 0]
  [else (+  1 (count-age (child-father a-ftree)) 
         (count-age (child-mother a-ftree)))]
  ))

;; sum-age : ftn  ->  number
;; finds the sum of all the ages in a family tree
(define (sum-age a-ftree)
  (cond
    [(empty? a-ftree) 0 ]
    [else 
    (+ (- 2010 (child-date a-ftree) ) 
       (sum-age (child-father a-ftree))
       (sum-age (child-mother a-ftree))
            )]))

;; average-age : ftn  ->  number
;; to find the average age of all people 
;;   in the family tree
(define (average-age a-ftree)
 (/ (sum-age a-ftree) (count-age)))

Develop the function eye-colors, which consumes 
a parent and produces a list of all eye colors in 
the tree. An eye color may occur more than 
once in the list.

;; average-age : a-parent  ->  loe
;; receives a-parent and returns a list of 
;;     eye-colors for that parent and it's children
(define (eye-colors a-parent)
 (cond
  [(empty? a-parent) (cons empty)]
  [else (cons 
      (parent-eyes a-parent) 
      (eye-colors (parent-children a-parent))
      )]
 ))

Develop the function find?, which consumes a dir and 
a file name and determines whether or not a file 
with this name occurs in the directory tree.  

(define (find? dir filename)
 (cond
  [(empty? dir) 0]
  [(symbol=? dir filename) 1]
  [else (or (find? (first dir) filename) 
            (find? (rest dir) filename))]
 ))
