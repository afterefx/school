matter 3 types
element compund mixture

periodic table of element
element is the simplest type of matter. Each element has a name

S,H,O,Fe,Au,Ag

compound is made of 2 or more elements

mixture, a group of 2 or more (compounds or elements) aka substance
mixture you can separate

heterogeneous mixture ice cream with oreos
homogeneous sweet tea

-------------------
Element gives you atoms when pulled apart
When you have 2 or more atoms they combine to give you a molecule
h20 is made up of 3 atoms b/c it's 2 hydrogen and one oxygen
a bunch of molecules gives you a compound

element-----> atom
              ||
              VV 2 or more
compound<---- molecule

Elements are made of a bunch of atoms
two or more atoms bind to form a molecule
-------------------
Atom
Atoms consists of electrons, protons, and neutrons

 electron      proton(+)
              /
    *->nucleus - neutron(no charge)



nucleus is very dense
located at the center of the atom
Electrons moving about the nucleus at the relatively large distance from it
atoms have a lot of empty space

protons and neutrons have rougly the same mass
which is 1840 times greater than the mass of an electron

A
 X
Z

A- atomic mass = #proton + #neutron
Z - atomic number which is the number of protons

  1                                     16
   H                                      O
  1                                      8

  Hydrogen has one proton                  Oxygen
                                           8 proton
                                           8 neutrons

Identity of the atom comes from number of protons

How about electrons?

In a neutral atom, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons

16
  O
 8

 8 proton
 16-8protons = neutrons
 this is a neutral atom so it is 8 electons

Atoms may lose or gain electrons to form ions
cations: atom lose elections to form cations (positively charged +)
anions: atoms gain electrons to form anions (negatively charged -)

anions:
16 2-            the 2 - means 2 with a negative charge
  O              8 protons
 8               8 neutrons
                10 electrons

cation:
7  +
 Li
3

                3 protons
                4 neutrons
                2 electrons b/c 3 protons = 3 electrons then you do minus one
                since this is a positive charge and no number in front of +

--------------------
7               8
 Li              Li
3               3

4n              5n
3e              3e

Isotopes are atoms of an element with different number of neutrons

Isotopes of an element have dientical chemical behavior
-------------------------------------------
Periodic table of elements

elements are organized based on the number of protons
elements that have the similar properties are in the same column
in a row the properties change periodically

metals occupy the left side of the table,they lose electrons to form cations
non metals occupy the right side and gain electrons to form anions
metaloids are semimetals lie on a diagonal between metals and non metals
