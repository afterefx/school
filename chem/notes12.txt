First law of thermodynamics:
energy is neither destroyed nor created in any process.
Energy can be converted from one form to another.

According to the first law of thermodynamic, change in univer energy = delta E = 0

H - C - H  + 0 = 0 -->  C=.....????

    H


delta E universe = delta E system + delta E surroundings


defining the system is up to you

system = universe - surroundings

heat = q

system which is a tea-pot q is going to the system

delta E system = E final - Einitial

delta E of system will increase

q is measured in the lab and q is equal to mc delta t
q= mc delta t

m = mass, g
delta t = t_final - t_initial = change in termperature
C is specific heat capacity
    the quantity of heat required to change the temperature of one gram of a
    substance by one kelvin or one 1 degree celsius

Element/compound  C J/gdegree celsius

Al              0.9
Graphite,C      0.7
Fe              0.45
Cu              0.39
Au              0.13
H2O             4.2
wood            1.76
steel           0.45
glass           0.84

Au will heat up water b/c it doesn't retain heat very well

CH4 + 2O2  --> CO2 + 2H2O + q
                        q= -880 KJ/mol

CH4 + 4O2  --> CO2 + 4H2O + q
                        q

C)2 + 2H2O --> CH4 + 2O2
                        q=_880 KJ/mol
