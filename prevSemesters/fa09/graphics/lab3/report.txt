COSC 4328 LAB 3
Hours: 13 hours

Problems: No problems really. 

Testing: All of my testing was trial and error from the beginning.

Solution: I started off with the trackball example from chapter 4 of the
	 book and started tweaking, adding, and removing vertices. I 
	 removed the spin function on there that he had. I also added
	 an eave with columns.  I added a wire sphere that you can toggle
	 on/off with the 's' key to help with the rotation of the house
	 with the mouse. I also added some control keys on the keyboard
	 'z''x' rotate the house left & right respectively and 'c''v'
	 rotate the house up and down respectively. If you are familiar
	 with VI I also added controls for the right hand. 'h''l' are
	 used to rotate left and right, while 'j''k' rotate up and down.
	 'q' can be used to quit, 't' is to toggle the way the items are
	 drawn. It goes from the original drawing method, to points, then
	 line strips, then back to the original drawing method.
	 The '+' & '-' can be used to zoom in & out. To switch between
	 the houses use '1' & '2'.
Sources: I used the trackball example from chapter 4 of the book as a 
	 starting point for this lab. The rest of the content is all mine.
