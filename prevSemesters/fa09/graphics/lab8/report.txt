Problems: Putting the orthographic camera into a first person pov
Testing: trial and error by playing the game. I would implement one
	thing at a time and test it as I put it in.
Solution: I took my lab 7 and gutted it. I then started implementing a way
	  to draw a maze. I setup my orthographic projection to where x & y
	  are only positive. This made it easier to draw the maps. After 
	  setting up my test map. I then executed a cube to represent the 
	  camera in 2d pov. I place the cube into a position on the 2d 
	  array and then move it accordingly. It checks to see if where it
	  is moving is a wall. If it is the move does not occur. After
	  having collision detection and getting movement of the cube. I 
	  attached a light to it. This gave me some problems b/c I was 
	  going from rows and columns to x and y so I had to swap the 
	  values so that the light would move in the correct direction. 
	  I also forgot that after updating the array in which I had the 
	  position stored I had to apply it to the light. I figured it out
	  eventually though. The remaining hours that I had to finish this 
	  project were spent trying to setup the camera to work form a 
	  first person point of view. I tried doing orthographic and 
	  rotating the whole scene to the camera, but I should have used
	  glFrustrum instead. My goal after that was to implement a map 
	  reader, however I was not able to move past the implmentation of
	  the camera.
