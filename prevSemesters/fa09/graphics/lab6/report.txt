Hours: 25 hours

Problems: One problem I ran into was getting reflections working. Other than
	  that everything before that went pretty well.

Testing: For this program I used a test scene that I created that looks like a
	 symbol of a dj that I like to listen to. I also used the scene files from lab6
	 and lab5. There was also the general one with a sphere in the center.

Solution: When starting this project I took my lab 4 and removed anything that
	had to deal with drawing in opengl. I then used the pseudo code that you
	provided in one of the beginning ray tracer slides. After having the ability to
	draw a simple sphere I then added in transformations quickly. Lighting took a
	bit of time to figure out the correct math equations and how to execute them.
	For shadows, I found that shooting a ray from the light and finding the closest
	object then comparing the closest object number with the object I was checking
	to see if in shadow was equal was easier. After doing shadows I decided to try
	and take a hand at reflections. Even though we had an extension on this. I had
	other projects that I needed to focus on so I was not able to come back and add
	on to this.


Stuff I implemented: * Generate primary rays 
		     * Intersect with spheres 
		     * Lighting works 
		     * Transform spheres with correct lighting 
		     * Multiple lights 
		     * Shadows 
		     * Reflections (turned off but code was worked on)
		     * Started photon mapping b/c I find if an object is in shadow 
		       by shooting from the light to the object :)


Sources: I used the slides that were provided on ray tracing and talked with
	  classmates about the math.
