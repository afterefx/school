statistical analysis

practical to graphical (aka visual) to analytical

practical what is it that you want to answer

give you a visual indication of the answer (can do this in r or any other package)

analytical is to give you a confidence on the answer

do all data manipulation outside of r, like in excel or numbers
then import into r once the data is formatted correctly

>getwd() %tells you what directory you are in

    Menu->Misc->Change Working directory->'select the one that you want'

> Helo=read.csv(file="HeloDat.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",") %read a csv file with headers and a seperator of a comman

> Helo %will show data

> dotplot(Helo) %will give an error, to create a dotplot you have to use a library called EIPCALC

> library(epicalc) %loads some stuff

> dotplot(Helo$Time) %case sensitive, time is the header of the column you want to use

> dotplot(Helo$Time, by=Helo$Rr)

> hist(Helo$Time)

> hist(Helo$Time,col="gold")

> boxplot(Helo$Time)

> boxplot(Time~Rr,data=Helo,col=c("red","blue","green","gold","cyan","yellow","purple"))

> plot(Helo$Rr,Helo$Time)

> reg=lm((Time=Rr,data=Helo)

> summary(reg)

> abline(reg)

> anv=aov(Time~Rr, data=Teim) %makes error

> anv=aov(Time~Rr,data=Helo)

> summary(anv)

> library(car)
