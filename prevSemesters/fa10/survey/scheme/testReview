-- Wednesday --
prefix notation - convert back and forth
conditional - give a set of conditions and will have to write a function that does that (if/then/else if/else)
repetitive - recursion, ask things like traversing a list, adding the values of a list ( that sort of thing)...straightforward
lists - also know how to do the sorting (know insert)
structures - how to define, know how to do a list of structs
6-10 questions
of course, functions

will need to decypher a function (tell what it does)
