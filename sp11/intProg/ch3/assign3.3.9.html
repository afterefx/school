    <span class="pre">At</span> the center <span class="pre">of</span> the storm <span class="pre">is</span> a leaderless and anarchic Internet group called <span class="noun">Anonymous</span>, which more recently has been <span class="verb">coordinating</span> attacks <span class="pre">against</span> Egyptian government Web sites. Late last month, <span class="noun">authorities</span> in the <span class="noun">U.K.</span> and the <span class="noun">U.S.</span> moved <span class="pre">against</span> <span class="pre">at</span> least 45 suspected <span class="noun">Anonymous</span> activists. Then, on Saturday, the Financial Times <span class="verb">ran</span> a story <span class="verb">quoting</span> <span class="noun">Aaron Barr</span>, the head <span class="pre">of</span> security services firm <span class="noun">HBGary Federal</span>, <span class="verb">saying</span> he had <span class="verb">uncovered</span> the identities <span class="pre">of</span> Anonymous’ leaders using social networking sites. <span class="noun">Barr</span> said he <span class="verb">planned</span> to <span class="verb">release</span> his findings <span class="pre">at</span> a security conference in <span class="noun">San Francisco</span> next week. <span class="noun">Anonymous</span> <span class="verb">responded</span> by <span class="verb">hacking</span> into <span class="noun">HBGary’s</span> networks and <span class="verb">posting</span> archives <span class="pre">of</span> company executive emails on file-trading networks. The group also <span class="verb">hacked</span> the firm’s Web site and <span class="verb">replaced</span> it with a message saying it was <span class="verb">releasing</span> <span class="noun">Barr’s</span> findings on its own because the group was confident <span class="noun">Barr’s</span> conclusions were wrong.
