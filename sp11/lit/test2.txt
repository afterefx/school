Dr. Jackson,

    I write to you today to appeal my case for seven stories that I find
    necessary to come along with us to this new earthlike planet. I have
    selected seven stories that I find most important and will list them in
    order of priority to be placed on the space crafts computer system.

    * Job 1 - This reading is important to me because it shows that there is
             evil in this life and that your faith will be tested. You shall
             persevere and be rewarded if you remain true.

    * John 4 - Within this reading we find a woman retrieving water. The
               significance of this story is that it teaches adultry is wrong.

    * Proverbs 10  is full of great advice and sayings to live by.  They should
      be easy to memorize and recall when you feel that you are being led
      astray to perform acts that would be frowned upon.

    * 1 Corinthians 13 should be included because it describes love. What love
      is and what it stands for should never be forgotten. I believe that this
      is a perfect description that we should all live by.

    * Genesis 22 is the story of Abraham being tested by God. God calls upon
      him and tells him to take his only son Isaac and sacrifice him at a
      mountian that will be shown to him. Abraham listens to what he is told and
      goes to the mountain. As soon as he is going sacrfice his son he is
      stopped. This story is important becuase it shows us that we should not
      only fear the Lord but we shall also completely trust him because we
      cannot understand his reasoning as an insect cannot understand ours.

    * Ephisians 5 has a general message that we shall always live life in the
      light of the lord because we never know when our day will come

    * Psalm 23 is a sacred song that says as long as you trust in the lord and
      he will stay by your side and protect you and you shall dwell in the house
      of the Lord forever.

    These stories mean a great deal to myself and being that reading is an
    interprative act you may not agree that these are the most important to take
    along with us on this journey ahead of us. Yet, based on my experiences I
    believe that as human beings we can all relate and find some meaning in
    these stories to make ourselves and this new colony better people as we look
    to expand the human race.

    Sincerely,

    Christopher Carlisle
