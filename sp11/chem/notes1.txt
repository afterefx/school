####### General Chemistry I ########

-Intro-
What is chemistry? Chemistry is the study of matter
The thing with chemistry is the vocabulary
What is matter? Whatever occupies space and has mass

3 states for matter
    1. Gas - has very high kinetic energy and particles move fast
    2. Liquid - has more kinetic energy than ice
    3. Solid - particle has some energy and moves around but has a low kinetic energy.

    kinetic energy
    solid < liquid < gas


SI units are used to find the
    volume - L, mL, 1000 mL = 1L
    mass - Kg, g, 1000 g = 1 Kg
    density - mass/volume
    length - meter, cm, 100cm = 1m
    temperature - Kelvin (K), Celsius (C), Farenheit (F)
        K= C + 273
        (F - 32) * (5/9) = C
        (C * (9/5)) + 32 = F  <-- check this it may be wrong
        0 Kelvin is very hard to reach b/c of 0 Kinetic energy
        Kelvin does not go negative
        temperature and heat are 2 different things

Measurement - the digits that we record in a measurement are significant figures - sig. fig.
    any non zero integers are significant figures
    any zeros between to nonzero digits are significant
    0.00013 = 2 significant figures
    0.130 = 3 significant figures

scientific notation modes
    N x 10^n
    N is between 1 and 10
    n is positive or negative whole number
